        "Ans:- Word embeddings are a type of representation that captures the semantic meaning of words. They are typically created by training a neural network on a large corpus of text, and the resulting embeddings are vectors that represent the meaning of each word.\n",
        "There are a number of different ways to create word embeddings, but one of the most common is to use word2vec. Word2vec is a neural network model that is trained to predict the context of a word. For example, if the word \"cat\" is frequently used in the context of \"dog\", then the word2vec model will learn that these two words are semantically related.\n",

        "\n",
        "•\tWord similarity: Word embeddings can be used to measure the similarity between words. This is done by calculating the distance between the word embeddings. Words that are semantically similar will have embeddings that are close together, while words that are semantically dissimilar will have embeddings that are far apart.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tWord analogy: Word embeddings can be used to solve word analogy problems. A word analogy problem is a question that asks you to find a word that is related to another word in a similar way to how a third word is related to the first word. For example, the word analogy \"king is to queen as man is to woman\" can be solved by finding the word \"woman\" because it is related to the word \"man\" in the same way that the word \"queen\" is related to the word \"king\".\n",
